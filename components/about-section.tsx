                Maria's is a small home-style Goan & Italian food caf√© born from recipes passed down through
                generations. Every dish we serve carries the warmth of family traditions and the authentic flavors of
                coastal Goa.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our cozy ambiance with just 12-15 seats makes it the perfect spot for intimate dining experiences.
                Whether you're here for a solo work session with our signature coffee, or gathering with friends over
                hearty meals, we believe food tastes better when shared with love.
              </p>

                From our famous Chicken Cafreal to our freshly baked croissants, every bite is crafted with care and
                served with a smile. As our guests say, "It's one of the best in Vasai" - a hidden gem that feels like
                home.
